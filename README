DrTM
======
This is the repository of our prototype database system of the paper fast in-memory transaction processing using rdma and rtm.
DrTM exploits advanced hardeare features such as HTM (Hardware Transactional Memory) and RDMA (Remote Directly Memory Access) to execute distributed transactions.DrTM achieves high performance by offloading the transaction's execution to a local processor using HTM, and uses RDMA to support distributed transactions.
Here is a single machine version of DrTM which we use different strategy for fallback handler.

Dependencies 
------------

* zeromq 4.0.5 or higher 
* Intel processors with RTM enabled 
* Mellanox OFED v3.0-2.0.1 stack or higher 
* ptpd 
* SSMalloc

Compiling
---------

At main directory, use
   make clean;make C=3 dbtest -j

We recommend using makeâ€™s parallel build feature to accelerate the compilation
process.

After the compilation,you will get an execuatable file named dbtest.


How to use
---------
Here is an example of starting an TPCC test.
./dbtest --bench tpcc --db-type ndb-proto2 --num-threads 8 --scale-factor 8 --txn-flags 1 --ops-per-worker 500000 --bench-opts "--w 45,43,4,4,4 -r 1" --verbose --retry-aborted-transactions
